    "For this example, `x` contains data in which the numbers 1 to 6 occur in different amounts. This is visualized in the histogram using `plt.hist`, where the number of bins can be defined by `bins=` (if not defined, this will be 10 bins). The number of bins represents the number of bars that will be present in the plot. When the input `density=True` is used, the probability of each x-axis unit will be visualized, otherwise the occurence will be shown.\n",
